        <p>I have ADHD.</p>
        <p>I did not learn about this until recently, as an adult.</p>
        <p>I've read many articles, if I can complete them, about what life is like once you know you have it, and how common it is to miss this diagnosis in girls and women. Our behaviors and habits are often misconstrued as something else.</p>
        <p>I can pinpoint exactly when things changed in my experience of learning, and it started in 7th grade. As an "MG" student ("mentally gifted", high IQ, placed in advanced classes, dork club, etc), I was automatically in "Honors"-level classes since elementary school. But in middle school, my sharpness started to change.</p>
        <p>I became an average or struggling student in these advanced placement classes. My ego would not allow me to register for a lower level of classes, and the best ways of studying I could find were to study with my mom using flash cards.</p>
        <p>I had issues reading books to completion, particularly when they were assigned as schoolwork. I would wrestle with reading a "Cliff note" version, or even the teenage girl books like Sweet Valley High my friends would also read. In just a few years I fell behind in my reading comprehension and memory compared to the other kids in these classes, resulting in my self-image starting to form as "not enough".</p>
        <p>In 9th grade, in arguably one of the more challenging math topics - Trigonometry - I did amazingly well in the class, largely because it was taught by an art teacher. Our class involved multiple methods of learning, including drawing and using physical art supplies to help color and illustrate the laws of trig. It was my favorite class in high school because I did so well and I truly understood the material. (I remember his face and classroom, and don't recall most of the other classes.) I later realized that the teacher, knowingly or not, was using Universal Design for Learning (UDL) techniques in class.</p>
        <p>To this day, whenever someone recommends a book to me, my first thought is "I'll never finish it". (The hilarious irony (to me), is that I started a "Mindfulness for ADHD" book 3 years ago and have not been able to finish it. Sad, and hilarious, and also enlightening.)</p>
        <p>With this new awareness, I'm now unpacking what sort of workarounds I've created in my life to succeed in the face of this challenge. First, and most obvious to me, is the Kindle. I bought a used $30 original Kindle off Craigslist years ago, slightly questioning the use of a "unitasker", but was curious about the portability it offered. The first book I read on it, and the first book I completed in years, was The Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson -- a 560 page book -- nothing to sneeze at. It was not an intentional experiment, to read a book of this size, it just happened. The Kindle masked how long a book actually was, and tricked my brain past the initial shock, giving me just the words on the page to focus on.</p>
        <p>I've leared that I do, in fact, have two superpowers, if I can harness them. While I don't believe in "multitasking", because the brain can really only do one thing at a time most of the time, I do believe that because my brain is naturally skips around constantly, I'm able to recall all of the things that need to be done and get them done. This comes in handy when I'm under pressure and the project is very complex. In my current role at my job, I'm able to flip around, answer team needs, and get complex artifacts complete. I've been asked how I've been able to handle the workload, and I can credit my overactive brain for part of the success.</p>
        <p>The second superpower is the laser focus on things that truly interest me. There have been countless times that hours slip by while I research something and learn a skill that interests me, or a method of problem solving for a thing I have to do in my house, to the point where I've forgotten to eat. That's right - I've forgotten to eat, and I don't realize I'm hungry or have to pee. Days have gone by like this. I've learned to crochet, paint, use Figma, weightlift properly as a skinny woman, and everything computer-related.</p>
