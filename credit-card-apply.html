        <p><i>The purpose of this project is to modernize the credit card application experience used by U.S. Bank's retail partners. This responsive, white label web experience is consumed by over 2,000 brands, so consistency and customization are essential drivers of this design effort.</i></p>

        <h2>Project kickoff</h2>
        <p>There are several core goals of this design effort.</p>
        <ol><li>First, reduce the time a user spends filling out a digital application for an instant line of credit.</li>
        <li>Second, make the entire experience accessible.</li>
        <li>Third, provide a modern, consistent, and customizable platform for partners and co-brands.</li></ol>
        <p>For perspective, the following image is the original application form.</p>

      <div class="w3-padding-16">
        <p>To kickoff the project, a design sprint was held with stakeholders. Afterward, my role was to amalgamate the voted-for design ideas and create low-fidelity screens for a prototype we would test in a usability study. I collaborated with the customer experience and research teams to define the parameters for the test.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After some conversations, compromises and tweaks based on our usability test results, I wireframed the first release MVP product in Axure. I studied hundreds of pages of business and validation rules on the current state application platform to understand the various products, partner nuances, and data mapping.</p>

        <p>Since the project's inception, I have created and managed over 50 wireframes for 80+ features, which include functional, interaction, and accessibility rules. My time is split between the refinement of "work-ahead" features, and supporting four development teams on their current work.</p>

      <div class="w3-padding-16">
        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <p>For the UI, I began with assembling a set of patterns derived from the bank's design system, called "Shield". The challenge was to leverage Shield, allow for partner color customization, and blend as seamlessly as possible with partner brands.</p>
        <p>I surveyed our partners to understand what might be pleasing to them beyond their customization options.</p>
      </div>

        <p class="caption w3-center">A selection of partner form styles. Harley-Davidson, Fidelity, and REI are three examples of partners that use a more traditional, default "boxy" feel.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-row w3-content w3-padding" style="max-width:700px">
      <div class="w3-padding-16">
        <p>In addition to partner customization, I wanted to also look at accessibility. Shield form elements feature floating labels, which have been debated in the accessibility space due to the movement of labels and smaller label text on focus.</p>
        <p>Floating labels are also a specific style and arguably "fancy", and I sensed that the pattern might be too <i>outside of the box</i> for the partners. I ended up going with a more timeless box style for inputs and dropdowns, but used or adapted Shield for labeling, radio groups, checkboxes, error handling, and headings.</p>
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>Managing a balance in decision-making in the midst of contending forces has been an ongoing challenge. I've had to negotiate really tough compromises through this work. Questions I regularly ask myself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can I align with the bank's design system without having the dev support to do so?</li>
          <li>Should alignment be weighted more toward the bank, or to the partners? (I represent the bank, but the partners are our clients.)</li>
          <li>How will I create an accessible experience if I lack the traditional resources to achieve that?</li>
          <li>Where can I learn to be a better communicator and a better designer when it comes to negotiating user needs and compliance needs?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Evolving a process, and growing with a team</h2>
        <p>Throughout my journey in this work, I've learned that there are many layers of complexity in supporting UX work and development teams in the financial services industry. When you think about banking, it's safe to assume that some groups struggle to keep up with the cutting edge not only in how the end user experiences their products, but also - and more importantly - <i>how</i> those products are built.</p>
        <p>I've been with this group during the enterprise adoption of SAFe agile, and in our early trainings we were alerted that it may be an uncomfortable few years before things settle down. While adapting to the new cadence, the process of change highlighted some glaring gaps of inefficiency along the way. Wherever possible, I wanted to close those gaps in order to serve as a better support for the teams.</p>
        <p>During the winter of 2019, <strong>I leveraged my knowledge of human-centered design</strong> to  organize a slight overhaul of our design artifacts. We were detailing too much, saying more than we needed, and versioning too elaborately. I wanted to say less — only what we needed to say — but also be sure it was what the developers and testers found useful.</p>
        <p>I interviewed and collected information from various team members on their experiences. The story that emerged helped me <strong>reduce the number of artifacts the teams needed to reference by an average of 30%</strong> (depending on the feature).</p>
        <p>I also was the driving force behind a brand new super-organized Sharepoint for folks to get whatever they needed on their own. This all may sound a bit odd and not very revolutionary, but these things did not exist, and as a developer in our group, the process of getting what you needed was ineffectual and cumbersome at best.</p>
        <p>The teams now operate with a bit more ease.</p>
